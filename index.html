    <p class="card-text">Few places on Earth look more like storybook illustrations than Neuschwanstein Castle. With its towers, turrets, frescoes, and throne hall, Neuschwanstein (or Schloss Neuschwanstein, as it is called in German) looks like it was plucked straight from your favorite fairy tale. But the story behind this over-the-top palace nestled in the Bavarian Alps is less idyllic.
      King Ludwig II of Bavaria commissioned the cliffside castle in 1868, just two years after Austria and Bavaria were conquered by Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War (sometimes called the Seven Weeks' War), effectively stripping Ludwig II of his powers. He quickly retreated into a private fantasy world, surrounding himself with opulent castles where he could live out his dreams of being a true, sovereign king. Ludwig II never saw the final Neuschwanstein, according to the Bavarian Castle Administration. He died in 1886, and the final towers weren't completed until 1892. But within weeks of his sudden and mysterious death, the magnificent castle was opened to the public, where it quickly became one of the region's most visited attractions.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Our Railway Tunnels Tour concentrates on the railway history of the tunnel network from 1863 to 1965 and beyond. The main tunnel is two-thirds of a mile long, with the far end being just inside the Broadstairs boundary and was first opened as a mainline railway tunnel in 1863, and from 1936, carried a narrow gauge electric pleasure railway until its eventual closure in 1965.
      The Railway Tunnels Tour operates monthly and offers a guided walk along the entire length of the mainline railway tunnel and, circumstances permitting, the option of a detour up the narrow gauge railway branch tunnel. There are features of both specific and general interest, including the mysterious monolith.
      Whether you live locally or beyond, why not join us for a different kind of walk between Ramsgate and Broadstairs?.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="card-body text">
    <button class="show">show more</button>
    <p class="card-text">Malcesine is a small town on the eastern shore of Lake Garda in northern Italy. It's a picturesque tourist resort with cobbled lanes and a castle, crammed between the blue lake waters and the massive mountain ridge behind, Monte Baldo. In the summer months Malcesine is a hive of innocent hedonism, packed with pottering holidaymakers gorging on ice cream and sunseekers draped along the lake shore. It's not all laziness, however, as the town's ferry connections to other lakeside resorts make it a good base for sightseeing and the cable-car running up to Monte Baldo is a magnet for cyclists, walkers and paragliders.
      Lake Garda is the largest lake in Italy, and Malcesine lies towards the narrow and mountainous northern end, often compared to a fiord. The town is situated at the edge of the Veneto region, in the province of Verona. 'Malcesine' is a good exercise in Italian pronunciation: the name is pronounced approximately MalCHESinay.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is strongly associated with the English and succeeding British royal family, and embodies almost a millennium of architectural history.
      The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I (who reigned 1100–1135), it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century state apartments were described by early 20th century art historian Hugh Roberts as "a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste"</p>
